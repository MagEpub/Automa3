# Automa3
Beginner Level scripts for the Automa Chrome Plugin

all these scripts are written for a simple page, https://magepub.github.io/github.io/

So if you upload them they should work, and the selectors, attributes and data should be the same for everybody.

*Manual trigger, open https://magepub.github.io/github.io/ in a new tab. Run this from any tab and it will open it in a new tab*
