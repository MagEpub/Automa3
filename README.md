# Automa3
Beginner Level scripts for the Automa Chrome Plugin

all these scripts are written for a simple page, https://magepub.github.io/github.io/

So if you upload them they should work, and the selectors, attributes and data should be the same for everybody.  Download the file, then 'Import Workflow' from the Workflows screen.
